This is a basic Purescript project.

## Haskell code highlighting for Glitch

You will have to run this javascript:

```js
application.editor().setOption("mode", "text/x-haskell");
CodeMirror.autoLoadMode(application.editor(), "haskell");
```

You can put that as a bookmarklet in your brower as described [here](https://support.glitch.com/t/code-highlighting-for-custom-file-extensions/1459)

CodeMirror is the js based editor glitch is using.
